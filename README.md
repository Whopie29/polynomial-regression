## Introduction

Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. This repository demonstrates polynomial regression using a dataset of positions and salaries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of positions and their corresponding salaries.

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
